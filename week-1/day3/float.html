  <p>We've covered the basics of a web page - the required elements, content, and metadata, and how to include other resources in your page. Let's get to the fun stuff now: your own content! HTML content provides the scaffold for your whole web page and is where your creativity really gets to come out. </p>
  <p> It's important to remember as we start learning how to add content that HTML is intended to be your web page's skeleton. When designing the HTML for your web page, you should be concerned about intent and purpose, not color, shape or size.^1 </p>
  <p> The Document Object Model (DOM) </p>
  <p> Before we dive in, let's get a clearer understanding of how HTML is interpreted by your browser. Web browsers implement what's called the Document Object Model, or "DOM", as the basis for interpreting content like HTML, XML, and SVG. The DOM is defined by the W3C and can vary a little bit between browsers. It defines a "tree" structure for our webpage, resulting in "parent" and "child" elements. It also defines our events and lets us watch for them. This is critical for us when using JavaScript, as the DOM is the interface we use to target elements and watch for events.</p>
  <p> Attributes & Special Content Let's discuss another important part of an HTML element: Attributes. We've seen attributes in some of our examples but haven't discussed them in-depth yet. </p>
